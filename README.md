Pressure is a survival-suspense game where you play as a submarine engineer on a grey zone reconnaissance mission. Following the mysterious disappearance of your fellow crew members, it is up to you to quickly master your submarine's systems while simultaneously fending off the dark threat that surrounds your ship. Will you adapt and fight your way to the surface, or will you resign yourself to the ocean's depths?
